Umm... no, not really.
Actually, I've been doing some fishing myself.

Well, that's rare to hear on this island.
The only two people I know who do any fishing on island are old and basically retired...

But heyâ€”if you're catching fish, you should let me take a peek at what you've caught...

I'm willing to buy them off you of course, this is a fish market, after all!

I promise to give you a fair rate!

Yes of course!
I'm open from 5am to 3pm, so stop by anytime

Sure, I'll keep that in mind...

Great, I'll see you soon!

See ya!
