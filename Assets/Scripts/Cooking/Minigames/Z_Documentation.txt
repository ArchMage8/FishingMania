How the new cooking system works

- The new system works similarly to old system
- It involves a recipe passing on the required information to the cooking manager
- The cooking manager then accesses the minigame manager and lets it handle the rest of process
*Note that recipes and the recipe list SOs are carried through to the new system

- The minigame cycle is started by the Execute Cooking function
- The function already checks that there are enough ingredients
- And there is enough space
