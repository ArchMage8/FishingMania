How the daylight cycle works:

- The "handler" script's job is to:
	1. Manage the actual time in game
	2. Control the world light's color and intensity

- The "UI" script's job is to show the time in text format [subject to expansion]

- The "Image" script's job is to show correct icon based on the time

- WorldLight Handler's job is:
	1. Take the time from the handler script
	2. Adjust street and house lights to be appropriate to the time in game
	*Is to be attached to world light prefabs

- Exception script -> prevents handler from looking for a world light indoors

- Varying interruptions:
	1. "Handler" for when we exit a building
	2. "Image" for when we save
