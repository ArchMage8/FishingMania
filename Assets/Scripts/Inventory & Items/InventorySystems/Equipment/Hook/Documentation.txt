How the new hook system works:

- Firstly a hook is no longer a scriptable object but rather just a piece of data
- Hooks are differentiated based on their class

- The data stored (in a JSON File) is a list of the hooks and their unlocked state
- Upon the game starting, the hook manager loads the current saved data onto an in-game list
- Note the list is temporary, and is only added to the save file when the centralized save file is called

- The equipment UI + fishing minigames, interact with this in-game list

Equipment Combo:
- The current equipment combo is a saved value
- It is updated when the player changes his equipment through the Inventory_Equipment Menu

Relationship between the Equipment and Hook Manager
(Specifically for the equipment combo):

- The hook manager's role here is to save/load the value when loading and saving the game
- This is to prevent making the Equipment manager even more complex

- Once passed onto the Equipment Manager, that is the In-game value
- All systems reference this value, not the one stored by the Hook Manager
- The value is only passed back to the hook manager when we want to save the game
