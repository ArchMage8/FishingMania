TLDR:

System interaction:
----------------------
The quest system works with Quest NPCs
They pass on their active quest to the system when interacted with

The system then decides if we can accept the new quest
If yes we can either accept or reject the new quest

But if we are returning to our quest giver, then the prompt changes to the NPC asking for what they requested
Completing quest is simply a matter of giving the NPC what they requested



Backend:
------------
The INK file has local variables that can influence the path of the dialogue
These variables are adjusted automatically by the dialogue manager
So the INK file's job is to just call the functions tasked in changing these variables


INK File Branches:
---------------------
As mentioned above variables change the path of the dialogue, thus several branches need to be made in order for the dialogue to feel realistic

IE it looks bad to simply just make the player not be able to talk to the player because they are occupied
